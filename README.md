# Parallel and Distributed Processing Project - Dictionary Attack
This project is for Parallel and Distributed Processing discipline for Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo in 2015/1.

This project consists in implementing the master-slave architecture to carry out an dictionary attack in a encrypted message.

Middleware JavaRMI is used for the parallel programming.

The dictionary attack consists in using a dictionary as source of candidate keys.

The attack will be realized decrypting the message with each word of the dictionary.

The encryption algorithm used is the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blowfish-download.html">Blowfish</a>.
